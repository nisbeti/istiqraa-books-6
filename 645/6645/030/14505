H., has delivered a sermon in which he dealt, at length, with different subjects, known or unknown;even those pertaining to the Day of Resurrection.S <span class="c4">[٣]</span><a href="#p1" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
<p><span class="anchor" id="p2"></span>As regards the state of affairs in the Muslim nation, it is noteworthy to refer to the golden epoch of Prophet hood and caliphate. The prophet’s Sunnah, i.e. his deeds and sayings, represent the second source of Muslim Shari' a. The Prophet, being the spiritual and temporal leader of the Muslims, attended to their affairs, decided on various issues, laid down the boundary-lines of the Muslims' rights and obligations, prescribed the appropriate penalties, took the lead in the battlefield, divided the spoils, led the Muslims in congregational prayers, corresponded with monarchs inviting them to join the fold of Islam. Besides, he regulated all matters relating to sale, lease, marriage, divorce, medication, burial procedures, inheritance, etc.<a href="#p2" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>

If it was in compliance with the main tenets and teachings of Islam, the Caliph would undertake it;if it was otherwise, he would con demn it.<a href="#p3" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>

It is quite inconceivable that Allah the Almighty, the Creator of the en tire Universe, may abandon His creatures without catering for them in all their religious as well as mundane affairs.<a href="#p4" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p> </div>
