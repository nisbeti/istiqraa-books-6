So judge between them by that watcher Allah has revealed, and follow not their desires away from the truth which has come unto you. For each among you we have appointed a divine law and a traced–out way. If Allah had willed, he would have made you one nation but to test you in what he has given you. So vie one with onother in good works unto Allah you will all return, and he will then inform you of that wherein you differ. So Judge between them by that which Allah has revealed and follow not their desires, but beware of them lest they seduce you from some part of that which Allah has reveald unto you. And if they turn away, then know that for some of their sins it is Allah’s will to punish them. And truly most of mankind are rebellious, do they then seek after a judgement of the days of ignorance ?<a href="#p1" class="btn_tag btn btn-sm"><span class="text-gray fa fa-copy"></span></a></p>
